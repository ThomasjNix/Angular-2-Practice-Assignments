<p>This is a small project I worked on for an Angular online class I'm taking, but I added my own little touch to it. Basically it uses cross-component data binding to create
a new component, either even or odd (based on a 1 second interval counter). I went ahead and styled it so it wouldn't be awful looking, and added some functionality to prevent
multiple intervals being created, which would prevent the "game" from stopping.</p>
